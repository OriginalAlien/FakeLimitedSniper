Credit to karlo since I stole his cookie checker and sender part for his cookie checker method

Tutorial:
1. Make a discord bot
2. I recommend to change the name and pfp
3. Copy your bot token and then paste it at the bot token part at the bottom of FakeLimitedSniper.py
4. Make a webhook and paste it in the "wh" variable at the top of FakeLimitedSniper.py
5. Make a channel on discord and turn on developer mode for discord, right click the channel and press "Copy ID"
7. Put the ID in channel variable (CHANNEL ID HERE) don't put quotation marks or anything.
7. Give the bot permission and invite it
7. Run it on a replit on a python replit or visual studio code or whatever you use to run bots on discord
9. Commands are; !startlogs, !help, !commands, !tutorial, !snipe
10. Done!

Enjoy
